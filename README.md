## About
I'm currently working in special education, hoping to shift gears to something more programming related.

I offer Python tutoring on a pay-what-you-can model. Don't hesitate to reach out, let's start your Python journey. Discord link in badge above.

I'm for hire! No formal experience, __eager__ to learn. Proficient (and fixated) with Python. Available for full-time remote work starting June '22.
